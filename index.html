        <p>Next to the river, I won a game of soccer. It was realy hard to run because it was so muddy. On top of that people kept slipping into the mud. By the end we were all so muddy it was impossible to tell the colors our clothes were originally! It was great.</p>

        <p>Today I am going to a medieval themed theme park. I am so exited! I hear there is going to be jousting and a dragon statue the is 10 feet long and 6 feet high! It is the main attraction in the obstacle course part of the park. I will update all of you when I get back. See you then!</p>
